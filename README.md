# CV template

## Description

This repository offers a straightforward CV template, written in LaTex, for academic and professional purposes. To facilitate section and title formating, 
some custom commands were created in the `Preamble.tex` file. Images must be added into the "Images" folder and additional `.tex` files should be included under the "Inputs" folder.



## Compilation

- #### **Default compilation**
Type `pdflatex CV.tex` in the command prompt.

- #### **Compiling to an output folder "output"**
Type `pdflatex --output-directory=output CV.tex` in the command prompt.
