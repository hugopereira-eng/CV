%-------------------------------SUMMARY--------------------------------
%\section{Summary}
%
%I am an early stage researcher in the Institute for Systems and Robotics (ISR) at Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon (IST/UL), interested in understanding robot motion under challenging nonlinear dynamics. I obtained my M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees in Aerospace Engineering from IST/UL in 2022 and 2020, respectively. During this period, I was part of a one-year exchange program at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). Throughout my academic career, I have been actively engaged in multiple student projects, including being part of the team that set the world record for the highest apogee ever achieved by a bi-liquid rocket built by university students, achieved during the European Rocketry Challenge (EuRoC), in 2021. One year later, in 2022, I participated in the largest Formula Student event globally, the Formula Student Germany competition, with the FST Lisbon team, achieving an impressive third place in the driverless cup. Some weeks later, the team went on to secure first place in the driverless category at the Formula Student Spain competition. During my academic years, I was distinguished with two Merit Awards endowed by IST/UL, and one Outstanding Performance at EuRoC 2021 Award endowed by DTU.  Some of my research areas include nonlinear control, dynamical systems, optimization theory, and reinforcement learning, with applications in space robotics.
